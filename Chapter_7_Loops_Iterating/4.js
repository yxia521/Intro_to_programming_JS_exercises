// Does the following code produce an error? Why or why not? 
// What output does this code send to the console?

for (let i = 0; i < 5;) {
  console.log(i += 1);
}

// The code doesn't produce an error since all 3 components of the for loop are 
// optional. In this code, we omit the "next value" component; however, 
// this isn't a problem here since we increment the loop variable on line 2.

// The code outputs the following:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5

// Although i is 0 on the first iteration, the loop logs 1 during that iteration 
// since i += 1 increments i before console.log gets to log anything. i += 1 also 
// returns the new value of i (1), and that's what gets passed to console.log. 
// Similar actions occur on each iteration: the output is always 1 greater than 
// the initial value of i, and i += 1 takes care of incrementing i to the next 
// higher number, then passes that value to console.log.
